This procedure calculates the total coverage amount for a specific policy type and provides a summary of the policies and policyholders for that type. This can help the company analyze the coverage amount and policyholder details for a particular insurance product.



CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GetPolicyTypeSummary (
    p_PolicyType VARCHAR2
)
AS
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Policy Type: ' || p_PolicyType);
    
    -- Calculate the total coverage amount for the given policy type
    DECLARE
        v_TotalCoverageAmount DECIMAL(12, 2) := 0;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name: ' || policyholder_row.FirstName || ' ' || policyholder_row.LastName);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Date of Birth: ' || TO_CHAR(policyholder_row.DateOfBirth, 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Email: ' || policyholder_row.Email);

Explanation:
- This procedure takes a `PolicyType` as input and calculates the total coverage amount for policies of that type.
- It displays the policy type and the total coverage amount.
- It then retrieves the policyholders and their details for the given policy type.
- The procedure uses `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` to print the results.

To execute the procedure and get the summary for a specific policy type, you can use the following SQL query:


BEGIN
    GetPolicyTypeSummary('LIC SIIP'); -- Replace with the desired PolicyType
END;

Question:
How can we create a procedure in Oracle SQL to calculate the total coverage amount and retrieve policyholder details for a specific policy type, based on the provided PolicyType, to help analyze coverage and policyholder data for an LIC company?
