Trigger for an LIC (Life Insurance Corporation) company could be to automatically generate a new policy number when a new policy is inserted into the "Policy" table. This trigger will ensure that each policy is assigned a unique policy number.


-- Create a trigger to generate a new policy number

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER GeneratePolicyNumber
BEFORE INSERT ON Policy
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SELECT MAX(PolicyNumber) + 1 INTO :NEW.PolicyNumber FROM Policy;
    IF :NEW.PolicyNumber IS NULL THEN
        :NEW.PolicyNumber := 1;
    END IF;
END;
/


Explanation:
- This trigger is named "GeneratePolicyNumber."
- It is set to fire before an INSERT operation on the "Policy" table.
- For each new row being inserted, it calculates the next policy number by finding the maximum policy number in the table and adding 1 to it.
- If there are no existing policies, it sets the policy number to 1 as the initial policy number.


Question: How can we ensure that each new policy inserted into the "Policy" table is automatically assigned a unique policy number, taking into account the existing policies?

FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.PolicyNumber := PolicySeq.NEXTVAL;
END;
